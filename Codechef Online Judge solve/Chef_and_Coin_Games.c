        /*n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - Player 1 wins by taking all the coins
        n = 6, any number of coins taken by Player 1 converts it to a game where n < 6 where he goes second. Player 2 wins.
        If n = (0 mod 6) Player 2 wins,
            Player 1 wins otherwise.
        Let us assume this is true for all n upto n = 6k
        Now, for n = 6k + 1, 6k + 2, 6k + 3, 6k + 4, 6k + 5, Player 1 takes enough coins to keep n = 6k coins so that he is the second player on n = 6k coins.
        By the induction hypothesis, n = 6k is winning for the second player so Player 1 wins.
        If n = 6k + 6, Player 1 can only win by ensuring the number of coins left is a multiple of 6 (by the induction hypothesis).
        This can only be done by taking a multiple of 6 number of coins. This isn't allowed. Any legal move is losing for Player 1.
        This proves the hypothesis.*/
